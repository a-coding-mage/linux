 * PA-RISC uses virtually indexed & physically tagged (VIPT) caches

 * "Address Aliasing" in the arch docs for more detail:
 * PA-RISC 1.1 (page 3-6):
 * https://parisc.wiki.kernel.org/images-parisc/6/68/Pa11_acd.pdf
 * PA-RISC 2.0 (page F-5):
 * https://parisc.wiki.kernel.org/images-parisc/7/73/Parisc2.0.pdf
 *
 * For Linux we allow kernel and userspace to map pages on page size
 * granularity (SHMLBA) but have to ensure that, if two pages are
 * mapped to the same physical address, the virtual and physical
 * addresses modulo SHM_COLOUR are identical.
